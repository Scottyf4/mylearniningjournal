            Hi there! My name is Scott and welcome to my learning journal.
          </h1>

        <p>
          After years of wanting to learn and playing around with different
          online bootcamps and training courses I finally feel settled with
          Scrimba. The interactive learning and on screen video / typing and
          muscle memory learning has really helped develop my skills.
        </p>
        <h2>How I stay commited to Learning</h2>
        <p>
          My desire to learn seems to be growing stronger and stronger as I pass
          through the Frontend End Developer course with Scrimba. The modules
          are taught really well by great instructors and the community is
          great. Having a brilliant Discord community to share my
          accoumplishments with and get coding reviews is a HUGE advantage. The
          feeling you get when you complete a solo project and then upload it
          for the community to see if great, and when you get your first review
          it feels fantastic and is such a bonus to help you look back at your
          own code that you made and then see how you can implemented the
          recommendations made is amazing.

              Bootcamp hell. I picked what I thought was the right bootcamp for
              me. I was wrong. Again!
