          <p class="head-blurb">
            After years of broken learning I finally feel like I am making
            headway with my Frontend Developer journey. I started thinking about
            coding many years ago, and they journey has been nothing but smooth.

            <p class="sub-content">
              I have always had an interest in learning new things, and one day
              watched a Youtube video on web Design. It seemed like something
              that really interested me. After doing my research I stumble upon
              some coding Bootcamps on <a href="www.udemy.com">Udemy</a> and
              started to work my way through them. It wasnt until I found
              <a href="www.scrimba.com">Scrimba</a>, that I truly fell in love
              with all things Web Design. From here I have been following the
              Front End Developer Careeer Path and Intend to see this through to
              completion. I am really looking forward to the sections on React
              and API's.

            <p class="sub-content">
              This is sometimes harder than you may thing. Beinga husband and a
              father of 4, finding time to switch off to the world and
              concentrate on code is difficult. The Scrimba course and its
              community keep me wanting to learn and develop. The drive to
              understand how things work and make beautiful designs is what is
              really driving me, and even after a long shift at my full time
              work, I want to learn more and grow as a developer.

              Bootcamp hell. I picked what I thought was the right bootcamp for
              me. I was wrong. Again!
